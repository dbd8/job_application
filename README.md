# job_application
LaTeX job application template


How to use the template:


- Place all your documents (pdf, png, jpeg, whatever) into the "attachments" folder and name them properly.
  Both the "application letter" and the "cv" will look at this place for your files.
  
- CV and application letter will come in separate tex files. Just modify the predefined sample data with yours and adjust the name/path of your included documents. If you use the default "attachments" folder than the filename itself is sufficient.

- That's it!


Cheers
